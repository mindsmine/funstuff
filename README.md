## Set Game ##

A SET is three cards where each feature, when looked at individually, is either all the same OR all different. Each card
contains four features: colour (red, purple or green), shape (oval, squiggle or diamond), number (one, two or three) and
shading (solid, striped or outlined).

## Concordance ##

Concordance is an alphabetical list of all word occurrences, labeled with word frequencies. The most important task is
the ability to split the text into sentences which are logically and grammatically accurate for the language under
consideration, which is a natural language processing (NLP) problem.
