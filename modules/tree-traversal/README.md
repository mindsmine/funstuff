# tree-traversal #

In computer science, [tree traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal) (also known as tree search) is a form
of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure,
exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. The following algorithms are
described for a binary tree, but they may be generalized to other trees as well.
